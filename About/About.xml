Harder difficulties for those who are not interested in combat.

I've never been super interested in RimWorld's combat. 
I never liked how you can't really build a cool base without increasing you wealth, and with it, raid points.
There is already so much [i]game[/i] in the rest of Rimworld's systems, that I like to just turn major threats off.
Peaceful difficulty exists, but in my opinion, it is too easy and boring. 
I don't want an easier game, I want a game where the [i]difficulty comes from somewhere else[/i].

This mod offers 3 new difficulties:
[list]
[*] Strive to thrive
[*] A bit of friction
[*] Endless strife
[/list]

In these difficulties, [b]all major and quest threats are disabled[/b]. 
This includes raids, manhunter packs, infestations, mechanoids, etc.
Extreme weather can still happen.
Insects spawning in caves on map generation is disabled.
Ancient dangers are peaceful.

To balance out this reduction in threat, the rest of the game has been made more difficult (compared to Strive to survive difficulty):
[list]
[*] All colonists get a flat -10/-20/-30 mood debuff
[*] Harvesting, mining, and butchering all yield 10/20/30% less
[*] Food poisoning, disease, and infection are all 20/50/80% more likely
[*] Research speed is 10/30/50% slower
[*] Trade prices are 10/20/30% worse
[*] Quest rewards are 10/20/30% worse
[/list]
