Harder difficulties for those who are not interested in combat.

I've never been super interested in RimWorld's combat. 
I never liked how you can't really build a cool base without increasing you wealth, and with it, raid points.
Peaceful difficulty exists, but in my opinion, it is too easy and boring. 
I don't want an easier game, I want a game where the [i]difficulty comes from somewhere else[/i].

With From Within difficulty, [b]all major and quest threats are disabled[/b]. 
This includes raids, manhunter packs, infestations, mechanoids, etc.
Extreme weather can still happen.

To balance out this reduction in threat, the rest of the game has been made more difficult (compared to strive to survive difficulty):
[list]
[*] All colonists get a flat -20 mood debuff
[*] Harvesting, mining, and butchering all yield 20% less
[*] Food poisoning, disease, and infection are all 50% more likely
[*] Research speed is half as fast
[*] Trade prices are 20% worse
[*] Quest rewards are 20% worse
[/list]
